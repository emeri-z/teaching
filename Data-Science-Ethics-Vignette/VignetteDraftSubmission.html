To that, educators answered with a resounding: &quot;yes.&quot; &lsquo;. Technology enabled a more hands-on experience allowing for better understanding of concepts and theories, and 90% of U.S. educators noted modern technology is important to students&rsquo; success. Today, we are proud to announce that 100% of U.S. educators now note modern technology is </span><span class="c3">essential</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;to students&rsquo; success, as technology in the classroom paves a gateway to a brighter future. It is incredible to see our progress over the last two decades, as President Clinton imposed a &ldquo;technology literacy&rdquo; requirement on all middle school children in 1998, declaring &ldquo;students should feel as comfortable with a keyboard as a chalkboard&rdquo; - we have not only met that expectation, we have exceeded it, as 95% of our student body has yet to touch a chalkboard during their education at UC Berkeley, and now </span><span class="c3">100% of the student body are definitely comfortable with a keyboard</span><span class="c0">, which is required for continuing your educations via Zoom teleconferencing technology.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zoom is but the tip of the iceberg for a continued advanced technology revolution - Zoom offers end-to-end encrypted conference capabilities for over 700 universities, while Amazon ships toilet paper and essential goods to 50% of the entire US population, Instacart delivers billions of dollars worth of groceries in 3 weeks and single handedly boosting our GDP, Netflix keeps 169 million people from going insane from solitary confinement and boredom, and Coursera has 4-5x usual traffic as thousands of universities request free access to the platform thus free content for their curriculums and significantly reduced need for staff and educators, and Coursera assimilates universities by &ldquo;helping them&rdquo; transition entire classes online, thus on its way to becoming THE University. On the frontlines of data and healthcare materials in battling this pandemic, Automation Anywhere is becoming AI Anywhere and soon A.I., short for A(ll your data) I(n our systems), as frontrunners to aiding Asia in sharing data and statistics about coronavirus as early as December, while good samaritans like ON Semiconductors donate 10,000 masks to healthcare workers. Last but not least, Apple and Google provide life-saving insight into the spread of the virus.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Technology is becoming ubiquitous and powerful in providing US citizens resources, and we are so proud to be the </span><span class="c3">#1 Public University in America</span><span class="c9">, and tied for the </span><span class="c3">#1 Computer Science program in the nation</span><span class="c9">, training top talent graduates to join top-tier Big Tech companies such as the aforementioned.
